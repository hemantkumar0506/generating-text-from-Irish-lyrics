# generating-text-from-Irish-lyrics
In this notebook you will use lyrics from more Irish songs then see how the generated text looks like. We make a own word vocabulary, preprocessing the data to generate inputs and labels for our model, build and compile the model, train the model and in the end generate the text.

## Technical Aspects

- Building the Word Vocabulary
- Preprocessing the Dataset
- Build and compile the Model
- Train the model
- Generating Text

## Installation

The Code is written in Python 3.7 and tensorflow 2.4. in google colab. If you don't have Python installed you can find it [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) & [tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/pip) here.
